      <p>Gold prices are universally quoted per <strong>troy ounce</strong>, but most people think in grams. Whether you're pricing a piece of jewelry, calculating the value of a small gold bar, or just curious about how much one gram of gold costs, you need to understand the conversion math. This guide explains everything you need to know about gold weight units and how to convert between them.</p>

      <h2>The Troy Ounce: Gold's Standard Unit</h2>

      <p>Before diving into conversions, it's crucial to understand the <strong>troy ounce</strong>. This is the standard unit used to measure gold (and all precious metals) worldwide. One troy ounce equals exactly <strong>31.1035 grams</strong>.</p>

      <p>This is different from the "regular" ounce you might use for food or everyday items (called the avoirdupois ounce), which equals 28.3495 grams. The troy system dates back to the Middle Ages and is named after the French trading city of Troyes, where precious metals were commonly traded at medieval fairs.</p>

      <p>When the <a href="/blog/what-is-gold-spot-price">gold spot price</a> is quoted as $2,650 per ounce, it always means per troy ounce. Never confuse it with a standard ounce — that mistake would mean a roughly 10% error in your calculations.</p>

      <h2>Converting Troy Ounces to Grams</h2>

      <p>The conversion is straightforward:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Gold price per gram = Gold price per troy ounce ÷ 31.1035
      </blockquote>

      <p>For example, if gold is trading at $2,650 per troy ounce:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Price per gram:</strong> $2,650 ÷ 31.1035 = <strong>$85.21 per gram</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Price per kilogram:</strong> $85.21 × 1,000 = <strong>$85,210 per kilogram</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can use our <a href="/">weight converter tool on the dashboard</a> to calculate these conversions instantly using real-time gold prices in any currency.</p>

      <h2>Complete Conversion Table</h2>

      <p>Here are the key conversion factors for gold weight units:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>1 troy ounce</strong> = 31.1035 grams</li>
        <li><strong>1 gram</strong> = 0.03215 troy ounces</li>
        <li><strong>1 kilogram</strong> = 32.1507 troy ounces</li>
        <li><strong>1 tola</strong> = 11.6638 grams = 0.375 troy ounces</li>
        <li><strong>1 pennyweight (dwt)</strong> = 1.5552 grams = 0.05 troy ounces</li>
        <li><strong>1 grain</strong> = 0.0648 grams (there are 480 grains in a troy ounce)</li>
        <li><strong>1 tael</strong> = 37.429 grams (used in East Asian markets)</li>
        <li><strong>1 baht</strong> = 15.244 grams (used in Thailand)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Understanding Gold Weight Units Around the World</h2>

      <h3>Gram and Kilogram</h3>

      <p>The metric system is the most intuitive for everyday use. Gold bars come in many sizes, from 1 gram all the way up to the 400-troy-ounce (~12.4 kg) "Good Delivery" bars held by central banks. Popular sizes for individual investors include 1g, 5g, 10g, 20g, 50g, 100g, 250g, 500g, and 1kg bars.</p>

      <p>Small gold bars (1-10 grams) are popular in Asia and the Middle East as affordable entry points for gold investment. However, smaller bars tend to carry higher premiums per gram because manufacturing costs are proportionally larger.</p>

      <h3>Tola</h3>

      <p>The tola is a traditional unit of weight used extensively in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and other South Asian countries. One tola equals 11.6638 grams. Gold jewelry and bars in these regions are commonly sold in tola weights, and the daily "gold rate" is often quoted per tola or per 10 grams in local currency.</p>

      <p>If you're comparing gold prices between South Asian markets and international ones, converting between tolas and troy ounces is essential:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Price per tola = (Gold price per troy ounce ÷ 31.1035) × 11.6638
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Tael</h3>

      <p>Used in Chinese and Hong Kong gold markets, one tael equals approximately 37.429 grams (though the exact conversion varies slightly by region). The Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society in Hong Kong still uses the tael as its primary unit. One tael is slightly heavier than one troy ounce.</p>

      <h2>Why the Price Per Gram Matters</h2>

      <p>Knowing the gold price per gram is essential for several practical scenarios:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Buying jewelry:</strong> Jewelers often price gold by the gram, especially for custom pieces. Knowing the raw gold price per gram helps you understand the material cost versus the craftsmanship premium.</li>
        <li><strong>Selling scrap gold:</strong> When selling old jewelry or dental gold, buyers calculate the offer based on the weight in grams and the current gold price per gram, adjusted for the purity (karat) of the gold.</li>
        <li><strong>Small investments:</strong> Not everyone can afford a full troy ounce. Gold gram bars offer an accessible way to invest in physical gold.</li>
        <li><strong>International comparison:</strong> Many countries quote gold prices per gram or per 10 grams rather than per troy ounce.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Karat Purity and the Price Per Gram</h2>

      <p>The gold price per gram discussed above assumes <strong>pure gold</strong> (24 karat or 999.9 fineness). Most gold jewelry is not pure — it's alloyed with other metals for durability. Here's how purity affects the price:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>24K gold</strong> (99.9% pure): Full gold price per gram</li>
        <li><strong>22K gold</strong> (91.7% pure): Gold price × 0.917</li>
        <li><strong>18K gold</strong> (75.0% pure): Gold price × 0.750</li>
        <li><strong>14K gold</strong> (58.3% pure): Gold price × 0.583</li>
        <li><strong>10K gold</strong> (41.7% pure): Gold price × 0.417</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For example, if pure gold is $85.21 per gram, then 18K gold has a raw metal value of $85.21 × 0.75 = $63.91 per gram. Read our <a href="/blog/gold-karat-guide">complete gold karat guide</a> for more on this topic.</p>

      <h2>How to Calculate the Value of Your Gold</h2>

      <p>To determine the melt value (raw gold value) of any gold item, use this formula:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Value = Weight in grams × (Karat ÷ 24) × Current gold price per gram
      </blockquote>

      <p>For example, a 15-gram 18K gold chain when gold is at $85.21/gram:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Value = 15 × (18 ÷ 24) × $85.21</li>
        <li>Value = 15 × 0.75 × $85.21</li>
        <li>Value = <strong>$958.61</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Keep in mind that this is the melt value only. A well-crafted piece of jewelry may be worth more due to artistry, brand, or antique value. Conversely, a dealer buying your scrap gold will typically offer 70-90% of melt value to cover their costs.</p>
