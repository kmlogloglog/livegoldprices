    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Live Gold Prices was created with a simple goal: to provide <strong>free, accurate, and real-time gold price data</strong> to anyone in the world.

It remains one of the most important financial assets globally, serving as a store of value, an inflation hedge, and a safe-haven investment. We believe that access to real-time gold pricing data should be free and available to everyone — not locked behind paywalls or cluttered with distracting advertisements.</p>
